# Content Filtering Enhancement

## Summary of Changes

We've enhanced the content filtering mechanism for the AI Research application to ensure that internal AI reasoning and tool execution messages are properly filtered out before saving to the database, while still allowing users to see this content in real-time during streaming.

### Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Tool Execution Message Filtering**
   - Expanded regex pattern to catch all variations of tool execution status messages
   - Added support for messages like `[Processing]`, `[Task started]`, `[Tool output]`, etc.
   - Fixed issues with inconsistent pattern matching

2. **Improved Whitespace Handling**
   - Added a regex to normalize multiple consecutive whitespace characters
   - Ensures consistent content in the database regardless of how tags are formatted

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Added tests for all types of tool execution messages
   - Verified filtering of all content types
   - Ensured all whitespace is handled consistently

### Technical Details

The primary enhancement was in the `ContentFilterUtil` class:

```java
// Updated regex pattern with more comprehensive tool status message matching
private static final Pattern TOOL_EXECUTION_STATUS_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(
    "\\[(?:Calling tool|Executing tools?|Tool execution|Tool result|Tool error|Tool failed|Tool execution failed|Continuing conversation|Step [0-9]+|Using tool|Task complete|Task started|Processing|Tool thinking|Tool output|Result|Executing)[^\\]]*\\]", 
    Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
);

// Added whitespace normalization to the filtering process
public static String filterForDatabase(String content) {
    // ...existing filtering code...
    
    // Fix multiple consecutive spaces
    filtered = filtered.replaceAll("\\s{2,}", " ");
    
    // ...truncation code...
}
```

This implementation ensures that all tool-related messages are properly filtered while maintaining proper spacing in the saved content.

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Database Storage**: By filtering out unnecessary content, we reduce the storage requirements.
2. **Cleaner User Experience**: The saved chat history doesn't contain confusing internal tool execution messages.
3. **Real-time Transparency**: Users still see the AI's thinking process and tool usage in real-time.

All tests are now passing, confirming that our implementation properly handles all expected use cases.
